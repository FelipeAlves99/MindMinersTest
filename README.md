# Dealing with possible error

For this error in your browser `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`. It means you do not have the SSL certificate of my machine. To overpass it, just go to `localhost:5001/File` > Show advanced > Proceed to localhost. By doing that you are allowing the api execution and now you are able to use the app at `localhost:3000`.

For this error in your browser `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. Probably the API is not running.
